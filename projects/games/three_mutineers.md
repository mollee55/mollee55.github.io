The Three Mutineers is a 2D three-player cooperative game developed by myself and two others at the 2019 Texas A&amp;M Chillennium Game Jam, created and prepared for judging in under 48 hours based on a given theme: \"All For One And One For All\" I used Adobe Photoshop to hand-craft the art for the scenery and assisted my teammates with puzzle mechanics, scripts to program the puzzles, movement, and tilemap manipulation.
