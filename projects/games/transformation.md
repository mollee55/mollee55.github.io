what_i_learned: "In developing this game, I learned how to create sound effects using Audacity and import them into Unity. I also learned how to import 3D models with rigging, move the 3D animated models, and program enemies follow the player. In addition, my team learned how to handle the graphical limitations of Unity when we hit a point where Unity could not render the graphics correctly due to an excessively detailed model in the scene."

Transformation was a game which I developed in Unity in a team with two other people for the Chillennium 2018 Game Jam based on the "Transformation" theme. The player wakes up in a laboratory bed, and realizes that he is part of a special weapons program designed to create super humans. While hording off waves of zombies, the player has a choice to solicit help from a friend, another test subject, to escape the program, or to leave their friend behind. The player must fight past the zombies and the final boss to escape the special weapons program and will either transform into a better person or into the monster that the program intended to create, depending on the actions of the player. What will you transform into? Check out our game on the itch.io link below to find out!
