what_i_learned: "In developing The Cursed Shadow, I managed the team logistics and travel to and from the game jam. I also managed the development of the project, and assisted other team members in various tasks, such as concept design, level design, gameplay design, gameplay programming, 2D art, tilemaps and background music. In managing this project, I learned useful leadership skills and other softskills such as being a team player, and considering what each team member needs in order to further the development and learning on the team."

The Cursed Shadow was a 2D game which I developed in Unity in a team with 3 other people for the Kansas State University 2019 Game Jam. This theme of this game jam was "Left Behind." The Cursed Shadow is a 2D action adventure game in which the player must traverse through the levels of the cave to reach the golden idol, all while fending off skeletons and dart traps in the walls. Once you reach the golden idol, you must be wary of what you left behind and race the clock to make it back in one piece before time runs out!
