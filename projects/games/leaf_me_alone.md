Leaf Me Alone was developed by myself and two others at the 2020 Kansas State University Game Jam, created and prepared for judging in under 48 hours based on a given theme: \"What Goes Up Must Come Down\" I used Adobe Photoshop to hand-craft all the art for the scenery and the flying squirrel. I modified a free-to-use asset for the lumberjack by adding an axe for him to use to cut down the trees. My teammates assembled the scene, did UI scripting, character movement, physics, animations, chopping mechanics, apple mechanics, and general scripting.
