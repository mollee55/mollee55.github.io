what_i_learned: "While developing this game, I learned the basics of 3D game development in Unity, including gameplay design, concept creation, level design, UI design, and storyboarding. I also learned how to create 3D models in blender and design 3D terrains in Unity, which was a very large part of designing our main map for the game."

Yggdrasil was a game made for Kansas State University's 4th Annual Game Jam, created by myself and three others. This project was created using the Unity game engine, Blender (for 3D models), and open-licensed textures. In Yggdrasil, the player starts out exploring a cave with only a torch for light. The ultimate goal is to find the tree of life, Yggdrasil, but the player must be wary of challenges and puzzles along the way!
