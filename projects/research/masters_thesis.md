what_i_learned: "Throughout my master's thesis, I spent a lot of time researching theoretical quantum communication, quantum information theory, molecular communication, molecular information, and the channels used to send both molecular information and quantum communication, respectively. I also learned how to apply this knowledge to real world scenarios, and how to convert the complex capacity equations of each channel into MATLAB code and plots to further analyze the comparison between quantum communication and molecular communication."

My master's thesis, "A Comparison Between Quantum Communication and Molecular Communication," compares and contrasts the two fields of quantum communication and molecular communication in the following sections: measuring information, comparing the types and capacities of the communication channels used, and the applications of both fields. As part of my thesis, I also wrote a program in MATLAB to compare the complex capacity equations of a specific molecular channel and a specific quantum channnel.
