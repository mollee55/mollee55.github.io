In my research paper on "Double General Point Interactions: Symmetry and Tunneling Times," my research colleagues and I consider the one dimensional problem of a non-relativistic quantum particle scattering off a double barrier potential from two generalized point interactions. We investigated the properties of the double point barrier under parity transformations using the distributional approach. In this paper, we show that the limit of the zero interbarrier distance of a renormalized odd arrangement with two delta primes is either trivial or does not exist as a generalized point interaction. Our ultimate goal was to calculate the phase and Salecker-Wigner-Peres (SWP) clock times. Upon discovery of the equations for these times, we discover the emergence of the generalized Harman effect, in which the tunneling time between two barriers does not depend on the separation distance between the barriers. However, we argue that the generalized Hartman effect only occurs in the extreme opaque limit.
